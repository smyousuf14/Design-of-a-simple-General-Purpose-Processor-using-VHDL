# Design-of-a-simple-General-Purpose-Processor-using-VHDL

This objective of this project is to design and  construct an  Arithmetic and  Logic 
Unit (ALU) in VHDL environment and implement it on an FPGA board. 

 -Design and build all functions of the ALU.
 
 -Design,  simulate  and  program  the  ALU  using  VHDL  on
an  Altera  FPGA  board  (Based 
on Functional Simulation in Quartus Simulator).

-Download the program on the FPGA board and display the desired outputs on LEDs and 7-segment displays.
